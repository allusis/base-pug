# SLDS PUG
A collection of mixins to keep the markup for your prototypes that are built on SLDS nice, dry, and easy to maintain. 

## In progress:
- Input form element mixins.
- A file and folder structure that is modular, scaleable, and sensible.

## To do:
- Find some contributors for help and sanity checks. 
- Update gulp to compile Pug and Sass files.
- Create demo pages so the output can be viewed.
